		1. Some ways my HTML on my Demo App could be more accessible is by making sure it is semantically correct.  Not using unneccessary, wrong context tags or more tags than I absolutely need.  Also, I need to keep my CSS and JS/JQuery in their own files and not code it in my HTML.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		2. Some frustrations would be not providing a proper description of an image in an alt tag.  If a person uses a screen reader it will not really help to know there is an image with out describing the image.  Also, a lot of unnecessary information a screen reader has to go through.  It should be an option if the person wants the sidebar and footer information with the contents of the page.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		3. Two devices that support accessibility would be:
		iPhone- I actually saw a vision-impaired person using the accessibility features to navigate through his phone and send a text via text-talk to say that he was getting on the bus and would someone be able to pick him up from his stop in 30 minutes.
		HTC -One S- This phone is compatible with hearing aids. Hearing aids can be used like a bluetooth and can even be used to listen to music. It also has voice chat that allows deaf/hard of hearing to sign to one another. This phone also has a vibration setting allowing those deaf/hard of hearing with a notification setting accessible to their needs.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		4. Siri is an excellent resource. You can interact with the phone in many various ways. The Android version that is slightly comparable is an app called Evi. It is used much like Siri.  Allowing phone users to send/receive messages, make calls, find directions and more all through voice command.
